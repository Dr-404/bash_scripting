# Function

## The advantage of function

- Reusability 
	- use multiple time in script
- Modularization
	- Functions help you break down your script into smaller, manageable parts
- Code Organization
	- group related commands together, enhancing the readability and maintainability
- Code Testing and Debugging
	- Functions can be independently tested and debugged

## Syntax 

```bash
function name {

	commands
}
```
OR

```bash
name (){

	commands
}

```


## Example Code

```bash
# Step 1: Define the function
greet() {
    echo "Hello, $1! How are you $2?"
}

# Step 2: Call the function
greet "John" "today"
```
# Handling variable in function

- Global variable
- Local variable

## Global variable

-  valid anywhere within the shell script
-  if you define a global variable inside a function, you can retrieve its value in the
main section of the script.
-  any variables you define in the script are global variables

## Local variable

- Internally declare variable within function is local variable
- the local keyword in front of
the variable declaration

```bash


fun(){
local num=4
echo $num
}

fun2(){
echo $num
}

fun
fun2
```
