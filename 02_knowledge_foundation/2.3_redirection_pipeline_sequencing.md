# Redirection `>` `>>` `<`

#### 1. Output Redirection `>` `>>`
- store the output of a process to a file
- Eg.
	- `echo "Hello World" > hello.txt`
	- `echo "Append this text >> hello.txt`

#### 2. Input Rrdirection 
- use the content of a file as input to process
- Eg.
	- `cat < hello.txt`



# Pipelines

- Shell allow to us the output of on process as the input of another process
- `command1 | command2 | command3`

- Eg
	- `cat example_list.txt | sort | uniq | wc -l`


# Grouping Commands 

 - Commands may be grouped by pacling them between parentheses

 - Eg 
 	- `(ls;date;who) > test.txt`


# Sequencing

- Unconditional 
- Conditional


## 1. Unconditional Sequencing (`;`)

- Series of simple commands seperated by semicolons (`;`)
- The shell will execute them in sequence, from left to right
- execute command whether previous command is fail or success


## 2. Condtional Sequencing (`&&` , `||`)



#### `&&` Command

- Second command is executed only if previous command returns exit code 0 
- It mean previous command `success`


#### `||` Command

- Second command is executed only if previous command return nonzero exit code
- It mean previous command `fail`


- Eg.
	- `grep -w admin username.txt && echo "found admin in username list"`
	- `grep -w testing username.txt || echo " testing not found`

#### Exit Code

`echo $? 	==> look exit code` 
`0` 		==> success
not `0` 	==> Fail
