# Essential Commands

## `echo` Command

- Use echo command to display text
- The echo command has a lot of cursor control using backslash `\` operator

`\n` 	==> New line

`c`		==> Continue on the same line

`\b` 	==> backspace the cursor (delete whitespace)

`\t`	==> tab

`v` 	==> move vertically one line


** `bash` need to use -e option to use backslash `\` operators


## `awk`

#### `awk '{print}'`


- default use `space` as delimiiter
- Eg
	- `ls -alsh | awk '{print $2 " :::: "  $10}'`

- If you want to use other delimiter, use `awk -F :`

- Eg 
	- `echo "1:2:3:4" | awk -F : '{print $1 " " $2}'`
