- These conditions give the ability to check file system within shell scripts.

## Checking directories

``` bash
#!/bin/bash

directory=/home/$USER

if [[ -d $directory ]]
then
	echo  -e "The $directory directory exits\n"
	cd $directory
	ls -alsh 
else
	echo -e "The $directory does not exits\n"

fi
```

## Checking Whether Object exit (Nested `if`)


![Nested_if](../photo/update.png)


``` bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if either a directory of file exists

location=$HOME
file_name="test.txt"


if [[ -e $location ]] 
then
	echo "[+] OK on the $location directory"
	echo "[+] Now checking on the file, $file_name"
	
	if [[ -e $location/$file_name ]] 
	then 
		echo -e "[+] OK on the filename\n"
		echo -e "[+] File with old date"
		ls -alsh $location/$file_name
		echo -e "\n[+] Updating current Date\n"
		date >> $location/$file_name
		echo -e "[+] File wit new date\n"
		ls -alsh $location/$file_name

	else
		echo -e "File does not exist"
		echo -e "Nothing to update"
	fi
else
	echo "The $location directory does not exit"
	echo "Nothing to update"
fi
```


# Case Statement

## Conditional Operator 

And = `&&` == `a`

OR  = `||` == `o`

- `a` and OR ==> `-o` can be use inside the bracket
