<h1 align="center">Linux Special Permission</h1>

[General_Permission_Link](https://github.com/Dr-404/Linux_Foundation_Class/blob/main/01_Basic_Linux/07_user_group_permission_management/7-2_Permission_Management.md)

- In addition to general purpose permission, Linux has three special permissions
	1. Set-User Identification (SUID)
	2. Set-Group Identification (SGID)
	3. Sticky bit


## Set-User Identification (SUID) 

- a user can execute file only if they have permission to execute

- If a file requires the permission of the root user during execution for all user, even who are not root

- File with `SUID` always executes as the user who own the file

- Eg `/usr/bin/passwd` (password changing command)

	- To change their password you need to access to `/etc/shadow` that hold user password hash
	- `/usr/bin/passwd` command can not edit `/etc/shadow` file if it had not `root` permission, so give `suid` permission to `/usr/bin/passwd`
	- you need to temporarily grant root permission or privileges


#### Granting Temporary root permission with SUID

- Enter `4` before the regular permission

#### Demonstaration

- Normal permission of file is `644`
- Adding SUID permission `4644` or `4744` (with exectue permission)
	- Capital `S` 	==> No execute Permission
	- Small	`s` 	==> With Execute Permission
- With UGO
	- grant permission 	==> `chmod u+s file`
	- remove permission ==> `chmod u-s file`

## Set-Group Identification (SGID)

#### Granting the Root User's Group Permission (`SGID`)

- Grant the permissions of the file owner's group

- Enter `2` before regular permission

- Normal permission of file is `644`
- Adding SUID permission `2644` or `4654` (with exectue permission)
	- Capital `S` 	==> No execute Permission
	- Small	`s` 	==> With Execute Permission
- With UGO
	- grant permission 	==> `chmod g+s file`
	- remove permission ==> `chmod g-s file`

## Sticky Bit 

- This permission does not affect individual files but directory level.
- it restricts file delection

- only owner and root can remove the file within that director

- eg `tmp`

- Enter `1` befor permission or `o+t`
