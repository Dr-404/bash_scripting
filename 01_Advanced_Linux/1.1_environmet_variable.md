<h1 align="center">Linux Environment Variable</h1>

## Variable in bash shell

1. Environment Variables or System Variable
	- Created and Maintain by Linux System
	- CAPITAL LATTERS
2. User Defined Variable (UDV)
	- Syntax - `name=value`
	- `value` is assign to given `variable name`
	- 


## Rule for Naming variable name
- Don't put spaces on either side of the equal sign 
- Variables are case-sensitive
- Can define "NULL" variable
- Don not use `?`, `*` , `number` in variable name




## Environment Variables

- System variable built into our system
- that control system look,act and feel to user


## Viewing `Default` Environment Variable


- use command `env`
- Environment variable are always uppercase


## Viewing all environmental variables (including shell variable, local variable, UDV)

- use command `set`
- in most cases will give you an output so long 
- more accessible fashion using set and piping it to the `more` command, as follows:
- `set | more`

## Filtering particular variables

- i use `grep` command
- `set | gep HISTSIZE`


## Changing Variable Values - `Temporary`

- `HISTSIZE=0`

#### you change an environment variable, that change only occurs in that particular environment; in this case, that environment is the bash shell session

#### when you close the terminal, any changes you made are lost

## Changing Variable Value - `Permanent`

- use `export` command

#### Before permanent change, you should always save the contents of variable to a text file for backup

- `echo $HISTSIZE > ~/backupHISTSIZE.txt`

#### More safe backup

- `set > ~/valueofAllvariable.txt`





# Changing shell prompt (PS1 variable)

- `shell prompt` - an environmental variable provide useful information for user

-  `username@hostname : current_directory`

- The name of the shell prompt can change by setting value for `PS1` variable

```
\u  =  The name of the current user
\h  =  The hostname
\w  = The base name of the current working directory
```

- `PS1="Hacker : # "`

- Linux terminal like window
	`PS1='C:\w> `


# Changing `PATH` Variable

- Most system command are located in `/bin` , `sbin`, `/usr/local/bin` , `/usr/local/sbin`
- If bash shell does not find the command in one of directory in `PATH`, it will return `command not found`

- Directories where terminal search for any command


## Adding to the `PATH` Variable

#### Always backup `PATH` before changing it

`PATH=$PATH:/home/dr404/bash_program/system_bash`

- This command assign original `PATH` plus `/home/dr404/bash_program/system_bash` to the new `PATH` variable


## NEVER ADD LIKE THIS (အခုလိုပုံစံနဲ့ စမ်းပြီးဘယ်တော့မှမရေးပါနဲ)

- PATH=/home/dr404/bash_program/system_bash

** Remember that you want to append to the PATH variable, not replace it **
