# Theory of Command Injection

- Operating system command injection vulnerabilities arise when an application incorporates user-controllable data into a command that is processed by a shell command interpreter


# Delimiter

- This is the operator (Chaining Command) for command injection



 ## Unconditional Operator

### 1. `;` (Semi-colon)
- this operator will execute even if the command preceding this operator is not successfully executed.

### 2. `|` (Pipe)
- The output of the first command acts as input to the second command

## Conditional Operator

### 3. `&&` (Local AND)
- this operator will only execute if the command preceding this operator has been successfully executed

### 4. `||` (logical OR)
- this operator is only executed if the command preceding it has failed.
